The APC is still having a manual system in the Student Assistant, they are having a lot of paper works causing them to consume their time when it comes to monitoring the records of the students. They don’t have their website or any application in smartphones where they can help the students to easily find their records in S.A. (Student Assistant) without going to Disciplinary Office. The students need to go to the D.O. for their reports and to know the things needed to do that can lead them in wasting time.
The student needs to render 15hours per term, some students did tampering their time to be able to finish right away or quickly in their SA. The office coordinators weren’t able to check or verify the students in an accurate or consistent way. If the student assistant lost their log sheet paper. it will be hard for them to justify themselves to prove that they acquire the rendered time in their specific office.
